# AG-cGAN (Artificial Genome - conditional Generative Adversarial Network)

Term Project for Machine Learning for Functional Genomics (COMS W4762, Professor David Knowles, Spring 2022) @ Columbia University. 
Developer : Yutaro Tanaka (yutaro.tanaka [at] columbia.edu)

Aim : Develop a cGAN model that can produce artificial high-quality genomic data for specific populations that are underrepresented in genomic studies, such as African and Hispanic populations. This work has the potential to be of significant impact in that it could eventually be used to produce or supplement training data for highly specific population (eg. Hispanic with heart condition, Asian with type II diabetes) from a very small sample population, and better understanding these populations.
